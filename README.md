# Analyze your Claude Prompts

I wanted to understand my Claude usage better. So I took Claude's help to do this. 

Here is what I did

1. Exported my data
2. Asked Claude to write a script that extracts all my prompts from `conversations.json` which is too large to upload
3. Uploaded `extracted_prompts.json` to Claude
4. Asked it to analyze at a high level

## Exporting Data from Claude

- Browse to [https://claude.ai/settings/profile](https://claude.ai/settings/profile)
- Click on Account â†’ Export Data 
- In a few minutes you will get this in an email

## Extract Prompts

1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makash/claude-dataexport-analysis.git
cd claude-dataexport-analysis
```

2. Copy the `conversations.json` to this same director.

3. You will need `nodejs` for the next bit. I am using version v20.11.0.

```bash
node extract_prompts.js path/to/conversations.json
```

For example, if file is in the same directory you can simply use `./conversations.json`

```bash
node extract_prompts.js ./conversations.json
```

If the file runs successfully you will end up with two files

```bash
extracted_prompts.csv
extracted_prompts.json
```

4. Upload the `extracted_prompts.json` to Claude and start prompting
